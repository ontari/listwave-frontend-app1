# ListwaveFrontendApp

This project was generated using:
* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.4.
* [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started) version 19.1.1.

##### Requires the [ListWave Backend App](https://github.com/ontari/ListWave) from master-branch to be fully functional

## Open new Terminal
```bash
//change Path to Project
cd </path/to/project>
```

## Install Project Dependencies

This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on.

```bash
npm install
```


## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

or 

```bash
npm start serve
```


Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
